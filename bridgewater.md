Introduction: 50 years of written-down investment logic as an AI advantage
>> Hello, everyone.
My name is Brendan McManus, the team lead of the applied AI team at Bridgewater Associates,
a systematic macro hedge fund.
I've been at Bridgewater for almost a decade now, where I started as a software engineer,
then became a systematic investor and researcher, and for the past few years I've been focused
heavily on bridging the gap between investing and technology.
I'm here today with my colleagues Michael Ran and Santi
Weight, our investor lead and technical lead
of this project respectively, to talk to you about a great tool
that we built internally called PAT, the Pocket Analyst Tool.
By the end of this talk, all of you
should have seen how we built an AI analyst that's
capable of performing hours of expert research work
in minutes — that's been internally deployed
to hundreds of investors and that learns
from every single interaction.
On top of that, we'll also show you exactly how we architected such a thing.
So before we show you what we built,
I wanted to go through some quick framing on Bridgewater's approach to AI.
Bridgewater has been spending decades — 50 years —
thinking about how to encode markets and economies into compounding systems.
And all of this really started with what you're seeing on the screen:
our 1980 bond system, written down on a yellow legal pad.
The idea here was quite simple.
Every time you wanted to make a trade,
write down exactly the rules for why you think that trade makes sense.
Write down the exact causal logic.
Because once you do this,
another investor can take a look at what you've written,
help you figure out where you went wrong,
and help you improve upon this process.
Every time you learn something new, you scratch out a rule,
you write down a new one,
and this creates a pretty incredible learning process
that has been the foundation of everything that we've done at Bridgewater
for the past 50 years.
Bridgewater's approach to AI: as investors and as practitioners
Over the decades, we've compounded upon this process
significantly, taking every lesson, every methodology, every rule that we've
developed about the trades we make — how and why — and codifying them into
an expert system that's both machine-readable and human-readable.
And it's really now that we're sitting on a pretty tremendous trove of data.
And all of this data is really what sets us up well for the AI era.
We didn't have to go back and write down everything for agents.
It was already there for us to draw upon.
Before we get into the tool,
I wanted to talk about how we're approaching AI at Bridgewater
more generally.
We're doing this in two ways.
The first is as investors.
As investors, we need to deeply understand
every major dynamic that's shaping global markets
and economies.
Just as we had to understand COVID or the recent oil supply
shock, we've also had to understand AI.
What's the shape of the supply-demand mismatch?
What's driving the buildout?
And how do these things ultimately impact markets?
This understanding is table stakes for us as investors.
The second way we're approaching AI
is as practitioners — which is what we're mostly
going to be spending our time on here today.
As practitioners, we're applying AI
across all aspects of our research process,
with the ultimate goal of building out
an artificial investor that's capable of the full range
of activities that our human investors are performing
every single day.
The research circle and the artificial investor roadmap
So what do our human investors actually do?
Well, we think about it as a research circle.
Investors are constantly perceiving
what's happening in the outside world,
formulating questions about what is true
and what they might potentially be missing,
performing analytical investigations
to try to answer these questions,
synthesizing their findings,
and ultimately taking anything that they learned
and putting it back into the compounded understanding —
the expert systems that we've built out.
It's really this last step that's key.
Everything that we learn as a function of this process
gets put back into a shared memory
that humans are able to draw upon.
And so you might imagine that if you're
going to build out an artificial investor,
they need to be able to do all of the different steps
of this research process.
You can imagine having built out discrete sub-agents
focused on each portion of the research circle.
And that's exactly how we're approaching AI.
We're building out discrete sub-agents
for each of these different things
that human investors must do, drawing upon the same understanding
that we've built up over the last 50 years.
But today, we're only going to be talking about one of these
agents — the one focused on the
investigation portion of the research process: the kinds of
deep analytical work that take our human analysts days and
weeks to perform.
We called this tool PAT, the Pocket Analyst Tool.
PAT: what it is and what it's not
And just to set expectations: PAT is not about how we trade.
It's really about performing deep exploratory research,
enabling our investors to go after questions that they
never would have had the bandwidth to pursue before.
So what did we actually build?
We built PAT, the Pocket Analyst Tool.
And from day one, the spec was simple.
We had to enable PAT to do all of the things
that our human investors are doing
as they perform investigatory or analytical work.
And that really starts with data.
What PAT had to do: data, tools, diagnosable analyses, context, and learning
PAT had to be able to search across
and read all of the different data that we have internally —
from structured time series data,
for example, stock prices going back decades,
to unstructured data, for example,
broker-dealer research pieces that we subscribe to,
or internal memos that we produce.
PAT has to be able to search across and read all of it.
PAT also has to be able to use all of the different tools
that our human analysts have access to.
All of the proprietary tools that we've built out
for visualization, for diagnostics,
or for evaluating the quality of the indicator ideas
that we've built out.
In addition to this — and this is where things
might get a little bit more interesting
for a technical audience — many of the analyses
that PAT is running would take a human analyst
many hours to run.
And this means that the analyses are quite complex,
which means that PAT's analyses
have to be completely diagnosable —
not just for humans, but also for agents
running in the background, reading through the traces,
understanding and making sure
that every calculation is correct.
On top of this — and this is really where
building upon all of the things that we've written down
over the past 50 years starts to pay off —
PAT knows all of our context.
It has access to all of our investment processes,
our frameworks. It knows exactly how our analysts
are supposed to be doing work, because we've been writing it
down for the past 50 years.
And lastly, PAT has to learn.
It has to compound upon its own learning,
not just for one investor, but for every investor
at the firm.
How a 50-year-old hedge fund actually builds this
PAT is not a prototype today.
It was actually deployed internally several months ago.
And we now have hundreds of investors using it every single
day, which is leading to a pretty incredible flywheel
of improvement: as investors use
PAT for real research, we have agents continuously
running in the background, scanning through these interactions,
figuring out where PAT went wrong,
developing human-audited benchmarks, which then
results in changes to context, and also
to the harnesses that we built for PAT — which results in PAT
improving not just for one, but for everyone.
And lastly, before we get into what we built,
I wanted to leave you with one question
that I pretty commonly get, which is:
how does a 50-year-old hedge fund actually
build out something like what you're about to see?
Well, it really starts with being
willing to shake yourself up.
Multi-archetype teams: investors, technologists, and scientists side by side
The team that built out PAT was ultimately
an internal applied AI startup that
was incubated within the broader firm,
with the ability to move incredibly flexibly and quickly
while being able to draw upon the resources of the broader firm.
In addition to this, we've established multi-archetype
teams where we have investors, technologists,
and scientists sitting side by side,
building alongside each other.
And I think this is really a key thing
if you're going to build out a product like this.
Investors bring the context and the domain-specific expertise.
Technologists bring the architectural capability.
And scientists bring the rigor.
It's really these types of multi-archetype teams
that are necessary if you're going to build AI systems
for expert users.
And speaking of expert users, we have hundreds of them
internally using all of our AI tools —
not just PAT — generating signal
daily on how these things should be evolving
and improving over time.
And lastly, we have a pretty incredible compounding
ecosystem to plug into.
50 years of shared data, tooling, and methodologies,
all built out not just for our human analysts to plug into,
but also for agents on our journey
to build out a fully artificial investor that's
capable of everything that humans are able to do today.
And so with that, I'm going to pass things off
to Michael Ran, investor lead, to go through a demo of what
we built and take you through the product architecture.
Demo: PAT live — oil supply shocks and the Middle East conflict
All right.
Thank you, Brendan.
[APPLAUSE]
My name is Michael Ran.
I'm the investor lead working on the Pocket Analyst Tool,
and a little bit about myself:
I've been at Bridgewater for five years,
where I joined as a technologist
but have spent most of my time in an investor role.
And nowadays, the thing I'm mostly focused on
is how we can infuse AI into our investment process.
With that, I'd love to jump into a demo
of the Pocket Analyst Tool to highlight its capabilities
and show you how investors at Bridgewater are using it.
Behind me you can see the PAT landing page,
which has the prompt we'll be using for today's demo.
The gist of it: we're asking PAT
to look at how markets have responded
to the recent conflict in the Middle East
and to compare today's events to similar historical episodes.
Then lastly, we asked PAT to put together
some visualizations that highlight
how similar or dissimilar today is
relative to previous oil supply shocks.
This is a real question we've been working on at Bridgewater
over the past couple of months,
and PAT has been a tool leveraged by investors
to help expedite our research process.
But before we submit the prompt,
I'd like to spend a moment talking
about an interesting security problem
The per-user security problem: every investor gets their own PAT
we ran into when designing PAT's harness.
Our starting point was: for PAT to truly be helpful,
it needs to be able to access all of the information
that investors have access to when conducting research.
But the thing is, at Bridgewater,
different investors have access to different information.
So for example, you may have one investor
who has access to what our positions are across all markets
today, and it's important for that person's PAT
to also have this information.
But then you might have analysts who are not exposed to this,
and it's similarly critical that we do not accidentally
leak that secure IP to those analysts.
So unlike a harness like Claude Code,
where everyone is interfacing with the same system prompt
and the same tools, each person at Bridgewater
has a unique version of PAT tailored
to what they can and cannot see.
Practically speaking, this uniqueness
is just a function of what context
and what tools each person's PAT has.
So with that, we'll go ahead and submit the prompt.
Time series search with human-like inspection: 50% to 90% accuracy
The first thing that takes place in this analysis
is PAT searches the web and our vault of unstructured data
to better understand what's happening in the world today,
contextualized against history.
Web search itself is table stakes
when it comes to these modern chat applications.
But the real differentiator here
is the breadth of unstructured content
that we subscribe to that PAT is able to search over.
We have a database containing millions of documents
from all around the world that includes content
such as broker pieces, earnings transcripts,
internal emails, and more.
And this database is updating in near real time,
with thousands of new pieces coming in each day.
And this ties back to the point I was making on the previous
slide: for PAT to really provide leverage, it has to access everything that
its user has access to, such that it can try and emulate what its users actually do.
Once this context is gathered, the next thing PAT does is search our time
series database for the data required for the analysis.
The plan is the analysis: clarifying questions and high-quality research plans
This is a database that contains tens of millions of series that we've been modeling internally
for 50 years, and this database contains data from the outside world — like the price of oil —
and also internally derived concepts,
such as what we think inflation will be 12 months out.
The search agents use traditional
search techniques like RAG, re-ranking, et cetera,
but the thing we found to be a huge difference-maker
was layering on an element of human-like inspection.
What I mean by that is: when a human researcher
is looking for data, they don't just anchor
to what the name of the time series is.
They'll look at the frequency,
the currency of the series, and then most importantly,
whether the values in the series align with their priors.
So embedding this sort of reasoning into our search
agent is something that got us up from roughly
50% accuracy all the way to 90%.
Now, after PAT has context and data at hand,
it comes back to the user with clarifying questions
and potentially ideas for additional angles to explore.
During PAT's development, we came to the view
that the plan really is the analysis.
If we can create a high-quality, detailed plan,
we felt confident that we could consistently take this plan,
intelligently execute it, and produce our desired outputs.
Santi will be diving into this a bit more later.
So while agents asking clarifying questions
is pretty standard in chatbots nowadays,
the thing we really focused on
was the substance of those questions.
We devoted lots of time and energy
into developing the context and benchmarks
that helped shape this capability.
We taught PAT what makes a good research question
versus a bad one, so this back-and-forth helps humans —
who tend to under-invest in planning —
flesh out what we consider to be
a high-quality research plan.
Parallel code generation: 3-task and 20-task plans take the same time
Now, after the ambiguous points are all resolved,
PAT enters its planning phase.
During the planning phase, the things it's doing are: A,
coming up with all of the data frames
that will be produced in the analysis;
coming up with the schemas of all of those data frames;
and then most importantly,
coming up with how all those data frames connect.
This planning phase is relatively expensive
from a time perspective,
but it's a cost we pay deliberately
because of what it lets us do during execution.
So now we have the plan locked in,
and the first step of plan execution is generating the code.
Given we have such a detailed plan,
we're able to generate the code
for each data frame in our analysis
in parallel using sub-agents.
And this works because each sub-agent knows
what data frames it depends on,
knows the schemas of those data frames,
and also knows what the schema of the data frame
it's producing should be.
So this lets an analysis
with three data frames or a medium-sized one
with something like 30 data frames
take roughly the same amount of time
to generate code in both scenarios.
Once we finish generating the code,
we execute the Python functions
with an agent overseeing this execution
and stepping in if it sees things like runtime errors
or nonsensical values.
And before we proceed from execution,
I want to call out the fact that the time series outputs
from these analyses land in the same database
that we actually pulled our inputs from.
And I think this is important for a couple of reasons.
One: it shows that any output from a PAT analysis
is indistinguishable from any of the human-uploaded series
that we've been producing for many years.
And more importantly, any output from a PAT analysis
can serve as an input to a subsequent one.
So this creates an environment
where humans and agents can very easily compound
and leverage each other's work.
Self-correction: PAT checks its own work before returning results
Now, after execution completes,
just like you'd want your junior analyst
to double-check their work before coming back to you,
we want PAT to do the same.
So at this point in the analysis,
PAT will look at the data that's been computed
and the visualizations it's produced
and make sure that the numbers seem sensible
and the charts look clean.
If it sees something that looks a bit off,
PAT will take a step back, diagnose the issue,
refine the analysis, and make sure it's satisfied
with its result before coming back to the user.
And then the result itself is this interactive report
where the visualizations look just like
the ones investors at Bridgewater are producing.
PAT is using the same in-house charting library
and leveraging the same existing text deck
that we've been developing internally for decades.
So you can see here how you can zoom in,
zoom out of these charts,
and you can even send the data from this interactive report
to our internal charting tool,
where you can make further modifications on the fly.
Before handing it over to Santi, I want to speak a bit to how PAT gets better
as you use it.
The Teach button: autonomous benchmark creation and PR generation
There are two primary ways in which this happens.
The first is the autonomous one that Brendan alluded to earlier, where we have agents reviewing
completed conversations looking for ways in which PAT can get smarter.
And the second one — and the one we'll be showing here — is the more explicit option, where a
user can kick off this learning process within the context of an analysis if they think there
is something to be learned from their interaction with PAT.
So right here, we just have the user asking for a different set of visualizations.
Note the user didn't say anything was wrong — they just wanted a different perspective that
they thought was important to answering the question at hand.
If they think that PAT should have produced or suggested this set of visualizations from
the jump, they can click the Teach button, which will then spawn an agent to go through
the conversation looking for things like behavioral mistakes, context gaps, or user steering that
can be front-run.
The user is then able to modify this or send it as-is, and when they submit it, what happens is:
first, an agent on the back end will create a benchmark that we expect to fail. This shows
that we can reproduce this poor behavior. It will then iterate on our context repositories
or the harness itself until that benchmark passes. And then after confirming that by making
this benchmark pass, we didn't cause the rest of our suite to fail, we get a Slack message
with the pull request, including the changes the agent wants to make to PAT. And the thing
this does is that the next time a human comes to PAT with a similar question, we expect them
to get the better version of PAT right out of the box. So now I'd like to hand it over
to Santi for the technical overview.
[APPLAUSE]
Hello, everyone.
Thanks, Michael.
I'm Santi, the technical lead for the Pocket Analyst Tool.
I'm sure many of you in the crowd
are building coding agent products just like we are.
And it's really hard to build one.
Coding agents are really fickle and unpredictable,
they often make mistakes.
And when you're really unlucky,
they'll go off the rails and try to nuke your data
and all the rest of it.
And so it's already hard to build a good product
that people like, but then it's really hard to build a product
they want to embed into their daily workflows.
At a hedge fund, we're trying to trade billions of dollars,
and so we can't have just vibe-coded analysis
be the underpinning of how these analyses go.
My background is in compiler theory
and programming language design.
Compilers have a very similar footprint of requirements:
they're fully deterministic, fully correct,
and reliable.
You can't have an off-by-one error
when you're flying a plane, for example.
And there's a similar shape here.
A compiler takes user code and compiles it down to something
like JavaScript, and a coding agent takes a user prompt or plan
and compiles it down to Python.
We really like this approach, and I don't have a lot of time
today,
but we're going to focus on this as a learning that maybe you
might be able to take home to your own work.
We're going to start with the chat agent.
The goal here is for the chat agent and the user
to come to a common understanding of what they're
trying to accomplish.
Santi Weight: treating coding agents as a compiler problem
The chat agent is implemented in LangGraph.
We primarily use it for persistent state.
It has out-of-the-box cancellations and continuations.
We used to manage that stuff ourselves
with a much worse effect.
The chat agent has access to tool calls.
Michael called some of these out.
So there's data series search, unstructured search,
and each of these would be a tool call themselves.
And then once the chat agent knows all the data
it needs for its analysis,
it's going to make a plan and invoke a tool call
to a sub-agent, which is our coding agent.
And that's going to produce a Python-Pandas analysis.
So why would you separate your two agents?
Early on, we decided that our investors are not programmers
by trade — they care about investment.
So we decided to keep the chat purely
about investment content.
And the result is that we have a product where coding
is a pure implementation detail.
From the chat,
you can't tell that there's code under the hood.
Other happy accidents: you get clean context,
so each agent becomes specialized
at its job and naturally improves.
And we get to tailor the chat experience a lot.
What we're going to talk about now
is that our investment domain context is really high quality.
We teach the chat agent how to talk
like a Bridgewater investor.
There's a lot of jargon to teach it.
And so the user and the agent both talk to each other
like coworkers at Bridgewater.
We also let our investors contribute —
Michael was showing that — contribute like a developer
on the codebase.
And this is a pretty good point.
Your user is better at writing context than you are,
most likely.
And so having low ego about it and letting them contribute
directly is a good way to win.
Chat agent architecture in LangGraph and why coding is a pure implementation detail
The last point I make about the chat: we teach the chat
agent not just context — which you end up with this nebulous
context that is very high-information but doesn't really
feel like a workflow.
Instead, we have step-by-step guides for the
agent on how to handle certain types of analyses.
And it feels much more like a product at that point.
Dependable workflows.
The rest of the talk is about my personal favorite part,
which is the coding agent.
This is a high-level architecture diagram
of the coding agent.
Everything you see here is actually just Python code.
It's influenced by LangGraph,
but there's no agentic orchestration.
Everyone's taking photos. That's great.
We're going to start with the left,
which is the analysis plan that the chat agent makes.
The analysis plan is broken up into tasks.
Each task maps approximately to one Python function
that's going to calculate a data frame.
Here's an example schema.
It gets a name, a description of what to calculate,
and then structural and semantic information
about the data frame that should come out.
We expect every task to deterministically compile
via LLM to a piece of code.
So two LLMs operating on the same task
should produce code that, when run, is semantically equivalent —
the same output values, exactly the same.
The result is that our analysis plan
isn't just a to-do list like you'd see in Claude Code.
Instead, we think of it
as a natural language Python project.
And because we have so much detail,
now we're going to go into code gen
and we can apply some fancy techniques.
The natural language Python project: deterministic tasks and parallel LLM gen
The first thing: we split it into tasks
and then do parallel LLM generation.
And because our plan is so detailed,
a visualization task at the end of the plan
already knows everything it needs
to consume from code generation that hasn't yet been completed
for loading data, say.
And when we compare this to Claude Code,
you can see that on average — for the same context and same plan — we're about
four times faster at generating code. But then we have this hyper-scaling, so a 20-task
plan takes the same amount of time as a three-task plan. So now we have code and we're
going to execute it. You'd want to just execute the code naively, but sadly, LLMs today
aren't perfect on our tasks, so they don't normally one-shot it. Instead, what we do is
take the task that came in from the plan and the code that was generated from
the task, then run the code, compare it to the task, see if it's correct,
and if it's not, edit the code and keep going until we're done.
The first thing we do on the code is static analysis, then figure out the DAG,
and we apply our validation agents in parallel.
Here, there are two tasks being validated at the same time.
So a five-task plan comes down to three layers, and a 20-task plan might be four
or five layers of validation.
The main point I want you to take away from this part of the slides is that
we enforce correctness in the architecture.
Again, no agentic orchestration.
Validation agents in parallel: enforcing correctness in the architecture
This is regular Python code, so the guardrails are really hard, and the agents cannot forget
to validate.
They are forced to validate.
The result is that when we run our test suite on any plan, 95% of
the time, the code that comes out is exactly the same for two different agents.
So it's essentially a deterministic coding agent.
And then because we have such a reproducible agent,
as we're scaling and hill climbing
and evaluating, we have something much more dependable
than vibes-based or LLM-as-judge evals.
Cool.
One more topic I'm going to touch on,
which is the execution layer.
Normally, coding agents invoke their code themselves.
They generate code, and then call it themselves
via terminal.
There are a couple of trade-offs here.
That's high latency with the tool calls,
and as you've all experienced,
they'll sometimes get lost along the way.
So instead, we run the code for the LLMs.
We do a classical static analysis pipeline
where we inject caching annotations into the Python code
to avoid re-execution and run it through a custom framework.
This is an example benchmark we have
for Claude Code invoking its own code versus Pocket Analyst.
We're faster
because we never double-load data
or double-execute intermediates.
But the actual win is not on the first time you run the code,
it's the second time.
Oh, there we go.
This is a benchmark where we take the last chart in a plan
Execution layer: static analysis, caching annotations, and near-instant re-runs
and just change the name.
Claude Code is going to go and rerun all the code —
basically the same amount of time,
though it is faster at editing the code.
But Pocket Analyst basically has instantaneous code execution
for the second round.
And this means that when you're working on the product
as an investor, you can make small tweaks
to your investment analysis without
the overhead of a regular iteration.
OK, we're out of time.
We had many learnings, but unfortunately
we can only cover these.
The first takeaway: we really believe
in specializing our agents.
We don't really believe in generic, powerful agents.
They make really cool demos.
I'm sure many of us have given them.
But it's really hard to make that a daily workflow
that you can depend on.
Instead, we take often very narrow workflows
and benchmark them very heavily,
and then we hill climb those benchmarks.
You can then compound the agents after the fact,
but it's harder to go back the other way.
And this last thing is kind of a thought exercise —
something I hope is exciting and someone might take away:
think of agentic coding as a compiler problem,
not an agentic problem.
Compilers have been around for decades
and they have a ton of techniques
for how to generate code more reliably, correctly,
and deterministically.
We'd love to chat about this.
With that, I'd like to shout out our direct team.
There were many others, but this is the direct team.
Thank you.
We're going to be outside for the AMA.
Three takeaways: specialize agents, benchmark narrow workflows, think compiler
We would really love to chat and talk about it
and see if you're excited by the problems too.
See you all around tonight.
Thank you so much.
[APPLAUSE]
