# Defeat Beta API MCP

**Defeat Beta API MCP** is an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server that exposes data from [defeatbeta-api](https://github.com/defeat-beta/defeatbeta-api) to large language models via standardized contextual interfaces, enabling structured and controlled financial data analysis.

## Installation
- Method 1: Run with uvx (Recommended)
- Method 2: One-line Install Script (Optional)

### Method 1: Run with `uvx` (Recommended)

The recommended way to run **Defeat Beta API MCP** is using `uvx`. You need to install it first by running `pip install uv`.

This method requires **no manual installation**, **no virtual environment management**, and works seamlessly with MCP-native clients such as **Manus**, **Cherry Studio**, and **Claude Desktop**.

**Step 1: Pre-warm the cache (first time only)**

Before adding the MCP server to your client, run the following command once to download and cache the package locally:

```shell
uvx --refresh "git+https://github.com/defeat-beta/defeatbeta-api.git#subdirectory=mcp"
```

> This step is required because MCP clients have a 60-second initialization timeout. The first download from GitHub may exceed this limit and cause a connection failure. After the cache is warm, subsequent startups take under 2 seconds.

**Step 2: MCP Configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "defeatbeta-api": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "git+https://github.com/defeat-beta/defeatbeta-api.git#subdirectory=mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Once added, your MCP client will automatically:
- Load the cached package
- Launch the MCP server in stdio mode
No further setup is required.


**Set HTTP Proxy (if you’re in a region where cannot access [the Hugging Face Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/defeatbeta/yahoo-finance-data)):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "defeatbeta-api": {
      ...
      "env": {
        "DEFEATBETA_GATEWAY": "http://127.0.0.1:8118"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Method 2: One-line Install Script
#### macOS or Linux
Run script to install:
```shell
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/defeat-beta/defeatbeta-api/main/mcp/install | bash
```

#### What this script does

<details>
<summary>The installation script will automatically perform the following steps:</summary>


1. **Installation Location**
   * The MCP server will be installed to the local directory:
     ```text
     ~/.defeatbeta/
     ```
   * This directory contains all code and runtime resources required by the MCP server and can be safely removed to uninstall.
2. **Create an Isolated Python Virtual Environment**
   * An isolated Python virtual environment will be created at:
     ```text
     ~/.defeatbeta/.venv
     ```
   * All dependencies are installed exclusively within this environment and will not affect the system Python installation or other projects.
3. **Download and Install MCP Server Entry Scripts**
   * MCP-related files are downloaded from the `defeatbeta-api` repository.
   * The script installs and configures `mcp/run.sh` as the unified entry point for starting the MCP server.
4. **Install Runtime Dependencies**
   * Installs the MCP protocol implementation and required runtime dependencies (including `defeatbeta-api`).
   * Dependencies are resolved and installed once during installation, avoiding repeated downloads or installations at runtime.
5. **Installed Directory Structure**

> After installation, the directory structure is as follows:

```text
~/.defeatbeta/
├── .venv/                  # Isolated Python virtual environment (used by MCP Server)
│   ├── bin/
│   └── lib/
│
├── mcp/                    # MCP Server implementation
│   ├── run.sh              # MCP Server entry script (stdio mode)
│   ├── install             # Installation script (for curl | bash)
│   └── src/
│       └── defeatbeta_mcp/
│           └── server.py   # MCP Server main entry
│
└── README.md               # Local documentation
```

**Notes:**
* `run.sh`
  Serves as the single entry point to start the MCP Server, compatible with stdio-based MCP clients.
* `.venv/`
  Contains all dependencies required to run the MCP Server in an isolated environment.
* `src/defeatbeta_mcp/server.py`
  Core implementation of the MCP Server, responsible for exposing `defeatbeta-api` data as MCP tools.

## Usage
- Use in Claude Desktop
- Use in Manus

### Use in [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/desktop/directory)

#### 1. Add MCP Server in Claude Desktop
Navigate to **Settings → Developer → Local MCP servers → Edit Config**

Open the `claude_desktop_config.json` file and add the following MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "defeatbeta-api": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "git+https://github.com/defeat-beta/defeatbeta-api.git#subdirectory=mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

After saving the file, restart **Claude for Desktop** to apply the changes.

Once the configuration is complete, hover over the **"Connectors"** menu to verify that **`defeatbeta-api`** appears in the list.

> **Troubleshooting:** If **`defeatbeta-api`** does not appear in the Connectors menu, or shows a **failed** status like below, run the following command to pre-warm the local cache, then restart Claude for Desktop:
>
> ![claude_mcp_failed.png](../doc/mcp/claude_mcp_failed.png)
>
> ```shell
> uvx --refresh "git+https://github.com/defeat-beta/defeatbeta-api.git#subdirectory=mcp"
> ```

#### 2. Talk to LLM with MCP

Once the MCP Server is configured and successfully connected, you can directly ask questions to the AI in Claude, for example:

### Use in [Manus](https://manus.im/app)

#### 1. Add MCP Server in Manus
Navigate to **Personalization center → Connectors → Add connectors → Custom MCP → Import by JSON** and add the following MCP server configuration:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "defeatbeta-api": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--refresh",
        "git+https://github.com/defeat-beta/defeatbeta-api.git#subdirectory=mcp"
      ],
      "note": "An open-source alternative to Yahoo Finance's market data APIs with higher reliability.",
      "icon": "https://github.com/defeat-beta/defeatbeta-api/blob/main/doc/favicon.ico?raw=true"
    }
  }
}
```

**Once configured, the result looks like this:**
