# DefeatBeta-API User Guide: Report Generation

## Overview
`defeatbeta-api` provides easy-to-use stock data analysis and report generation features. Using the `tearsheet` module, you can quickly generate HTML reports for a stock and view them directly in a web browser.

This guide shows two ways to try it:  
1. **Try it on Notebook** – online via Binder, no installation needed.  
2. **Try it on Local** – run locally after installing `defeatbeta-api`.

## Try it on Notebook

You can try this example directly in a Jupyter notebook via Binder:

> This option is ideal if you want to test without installing anything locally. The notebook contains the same example code and will generate a report you can view in the browser.

## Try it on Local

### Installation
Make sure `defeatbeta-api` is installed:

```bash
pip install defeatbeta-api
```

### Generate a Report

Here is a simple example showing how to generate a stock report for Alibaba (BABA):
```python
from defeatbeta_api.data.ticker import Ticker
import defeatbeta_api.reports.tearsheet as tearsheet

# Create a Ticker object
ticker = Ticker("BABA")

# Generate an HTML report
tearsheet.html(ticker, output='/tmp/test.html')
```
